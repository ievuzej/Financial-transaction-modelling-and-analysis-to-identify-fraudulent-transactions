# Financial-transaction-modelling-and-analysis-to-identify-fraudulent-transactions

The challenge:

_Every year billions of pounds are lost to credit card fraud. While fraud is a substantial cost to the financial system, so too is the cost of detecting credit card fraud. In a competitive market, banks need to balance the cost of fraud against the impact on customer experience of onerous controls. In other words, false positives in the fraud detection process can lead to customer transactions being erroneously declined. This highlights the need for effective detection systems with low rates of error.
Your task, as a data analyst working for a large financial services advisory firm, is to analyse a set of transactions, develop the respective feature inputs and create an appropriate, scalable model for predicting potential fraudulent transactions_
